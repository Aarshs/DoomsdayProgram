# First figure out if the year is leap year

# What doomsday is it by century 2000 - Tuesday - 2

# 1st finger - 2
# 2nd finger - 20/12 = 1 R 8
# 3rd finger - 8
# 4th finegr - 8/4 = 2
# == 13
# Which is 13/7 = 1 R 6
# Since r = 6 doomsday is sixturday

# Since doomsday for July is 7/11, 7/11 is saturday
# 20 - 11 = 9, so 9 days after saturday
# 9/7 = 1 R 2, since R = 2, 2 days after saturday
#  == Monday
